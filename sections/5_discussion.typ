== Interpretation of Findings

This study examined whether suppressive reputation management operates systematically in Germany's point-of-interest economy. The empirical evidence establishes that it does. During the 4.7-month study period, Google removed 1,512,595 reviews from Google Maps in response to German defamation claims, representing 99.84% of all legally-motivated content removals sent to Google Maps across the entire European Union. Complementary analysis of complaint-level data from a different time period reveals that when German businesses contest reviews through defamation claims, removal occurs in 85.45% of cases [95% CI: 83.2%; 87.7%]. The conjunction of extreme removal volumes and high success rates indicates that review suppression functions as an institutionalized practice rather than an occasional legal remedy.

The reliability of removal outcomes transforms the strategic calculus for reputation management. When success rates approach 85%, contesting negative reviews becomes a predictable intervention with calculable returns, not an uncertain legal process with variable outcomes. This aligns with #cite(<shapiro_premiums_1983>, form: "prose") framework of reputation as intangible capital: firms invest in reputational assets when they can expect measurable returns. The narrow confidence interval [83.2%; 87.7%] indicates stability: removal is not merely possible but expected. This predictability distinguishes suppression in Germany from reputation management in jurisdictions where legal challenges remain genuinely adversarial.

The procedural pathway through which businesses achieve these outcomes reinforces this interpretation. Table 5 demonstrated that 99.99% of German removals cite direct defamation claims rather than court orders. Businesses achieve high success rates without obtaining judicial determinations first. They file complaints directly with Google through standardized Notice and Takedown forms, assert that reviews lack customer relationships or contain defamatory statements, and receive decisions within one day in the median case @google_vlosevlop_2025. Courts function primarily as off-stage enforcers whose precedents shape platform behavior, but individual businesses need not engage the judicial system to achieve removal. This proceduralization is precisely what enables both high success rates and the 1.5 million removal volume: platforms apply standards designed to minimize liability risk rather than adjudicating claims on their merits.

The emergence of specialized deletion agencies (Löschagenturen) provides further evidence of systematization. These service providers advertise fixed-price removal packages with claimed success rates exceeding 90% @wulfers_warum_2025, figures that align closely with the observed 85% success rate. These agencies are not selling legal expertise to navigate complex litigation; they are selling access to a proceduralized system where filing the correct forms with standard language produces reliable results. The existence of such agencies and their ability to guarantee outcomes confirms that removal functions as a commoditized service rather than a bespoke legal intervention requiring case-specific strategy. When a practice can be packaged into fixed-price offerings marketed to any business seeking to eliminate negative feedback, it has transitioned from exceptional remedy to routine business tool.

This outcome reflects the convergence of aligned incentives between businesses and platforms. Businesses face strong economic motivation to remove negative reviews because negativity bias means that a single one-star review inflicts more damage than multiple five-star reviews can repair @baumeister_bad_2001. For platforms operating in Germany, expansive personality-rights protections and Federal Court rulings convert legal notice into obligation, making removal the economically rational response to liability risk @noauthor_bgh_2014 @noauthor_bgh_2016 @noauthor_bgh_2022. When businesses seeking suppression face platforms seeking liability avoidance, and when procedural asymmetries prevent effective verification of claims, systematic deletion becomes a predictable equilibrium outcome. The institutional framework does not merely permit suppression; it incentivizes both sides of the market to participate in it.

== Implications

=== For Business Strategy

The findings suggest that reputation management has evolved from a reactive communication function into a strategic, quasi-legal tactic for competitive positioning. When defamation-based takedown procedures yield removal success rates above 80%, suppression becomes a predictable input in marketing operations rather than an exceptional legal remedy. This procedural reliability allows firms to incorporate deletion services into reputation budgets, outsource compliance tasks to specialized agencies, and optimize perceived quality scores through legal rather than experiential means.

For individual businesses, the cost–benefit structure favors suppression: deletion is faster, cheaper, and more certain than rectifying service quality or generating offsetting positive feedback. However, the apparent short-term benefits of “reputation laundering” obscure longer-term risks. By depending on concealment rather than improvement, firms forgo genuine quality signals that could guide operational learning. Furthermore, the homogenization of visible ratings may erode differentiation, making competition increasingly driven by legal agility instead of consumer satisfaction. As Löschagenturen proliferate, reputation itself risks commodification — shifting from a trust-based attribute of performance into a purchasable output.
