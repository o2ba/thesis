Step 1 – Empirical observation


Germany accounts for > 99 % of all Article 16 defamation removals on Google Maps.


Step 2 – Legal / contextual knowns


In the German legal system, defamation actions almost always concern user statements that are negative, reputation‑damaging, or critical.


Step 3 – Platform context


The only user‑generated statements on Google Maps that plausibly fit this definition are reviews.


Step 4 – External corroboration


Existence of commercial services that advertise “removing bad reviews for legal reasons” shows this process is actively used to suppress negative evaluations.


→ Conclusion (defensible assumption)


Therefore, it is reasonable to interpret the volume of German defamation removals as a proxy for removal of negative or critical reviews.
