== Declaration of Independent Work and Statement on the Use of AI Tools

#set par(first-line-indent: 0em)

I, Bade Obari, declare that I have written the submitted Bachelor’s thesis independently and have not used any sources or aids other than those indicated. All content taken verbatim or in paraphrased form from other works has been clearly identified and cited in the Bibliography or the Appendix.

In preparing this thesis, I made limited and responsible use of generative AI tools. ChatGPT (via the Frankfurt School EDU subscription) was used to improve the flow, clarity, and language of certain passages. Claude 4.5 was used occasionally to obtain structural feedback and to reflect on the logical organisation and coherence of chapters.

All substantive ideas, analysis, argumentation, and conclusions are entirely my own. The AI tools served solely an auxiliary role for linguistic and structural support.

The submitted Bachelor’s thesis has not been, and is not, the subject of any other examination process, either in full or in substantial parts.

This declaration is made in accordance with § 11 (7) of the General Course and Examination Regulations (GCER) of Frankfurt School of Finance & Management and in the spirit of academic integrity and transparency.
