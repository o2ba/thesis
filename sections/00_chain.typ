H2: Controlling for business characteristics, the association between filing Article 16 DSA takedown requests and elevated ratings is significantly stronger in Germany than in other EU member states, with German requesters showing a positive rating premium relative to matched non-requesters, while requesters in other jurisdictions show no such premium.

- H2a The rating differential between businesses that file Article 16 DSA takedown requests and matched non-requesters is significantly larger in Germany than in comparable EU jurisdictions (France), where institutional conditions do not enable systematic suppression.

1. Suppression offers strategic advantages over additive strategies
   → Negativity bias, permanence, legal legitimacy
   
2. But suppression requires institutional enablement
   → Legal grounds + Platform liability + Low transaction costs
   
3. OBSERVATION: Suppression deployment is concentrated in Germany
   → 99.85% of DSA defamation removals (Document 1)
   
4. HYPOTHESIS: This concentration reflects differential platform compliance
   → H1: Test enforcement rates by country using Lumen data
   
5. IMPLICATION: German firms possess marketing capabilities unavailable elsewhere
   → Reputation management as market-specific competitive advantage


Potential H2 Systematic suppression distorts the informational environment, with German business locations showing artificially elevated ratings compared to the same firms' non-German locations.
